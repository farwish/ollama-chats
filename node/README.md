# node

This is an alternative way to serve the root file index.html

If you only have nodejs installed on your machine, and do not have to Nginx.

Just run following command in this directory:

```bash
$ yarn && node express.js
```

Than, you can open browser: http://localhost:8089

Note: only for local use, do not direct deploy on public net.
